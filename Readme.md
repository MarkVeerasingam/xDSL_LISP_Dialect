# xDSL - LISP Dialect
## A simple dialect xDSL project

## Overview
**xDSL - LISP Dialect**, a project inspired by the [xDSL Toy Example Language](https://github.com/xdslproject/xdsl/tree/main/docs/Toy). This project aims to implement a **LISP-style language** using the **xDSL framework**, with a focus on simplicity and modularity. The goal is to provide a minimal, extensible LISP-like dialect that can be compiled and executed efficiently. The dialect will eventually be able to run on an emulator, specifically targeting **RISC-V** architecture.
