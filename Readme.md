# xDSL - LISP Dialect
## A simple dialect xDSL project

## Overview
**xDSL - LISP Dialect**, a project inspired by the [xDSL Toy Example Language](https://github.com/xdslproject/xdsl/tree/main/docs/Toy). This project aims to implement a **LISP-style language** using the **xDSL framework**. 

The end goal is to support both **compilation to LLVM IR** and **execution on a RISC-V emulator**, allowing the language to serve as a learning tool for xDSL
